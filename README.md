This is the **Obsidian edition** of LLM Text Assistant — the browser extension (Chrome/Firefox/Thunderbird) by the same author, with the same actions, prompts and streaming behaviour, adapted to the Obsidian editor.

## ✨ Key Features

### 📌 Core Features
- **Four built-in actions**: 🌐 Translate, ✍️ Expand, 📋 Summarize, ✅ Grammar & Spelling, available via the editor context menu (right-click), the command palette, the ribbon icon ✨ and its action menu
- **Custom actions**: Define your own actions with emoji, title and system prompt
- **Free Prompt (Chat mode)**: Open a chat window with the current selection as context and give iterative instructions with full context; apply the result back into the note
- **Copy responses**: Hover any response for its ⧉ copy button, use "Copy last response", or press Ctrl/Cmd+C with nothing selected
- **Streaming results (live typing)**: Text appears token by token as the model generates it, no waiting for the full response
- **Selection or whole note**: Processes the selection — or the entire note when nothing is selected

### ⌨️ UX
- **Undo toast**: After every replacement a toast appears with an **Undo** button (8 seconds)
- **Cancel requests**: Abort a running request by clicking the "Processing…" toast or the stop button in chat, already received text is kept
- **Native Obsidian hotkeys**: Every action is a command — assign hotkeys via Obsidian's Hotkeys settings
- **Robust error handling**: Configurable timeout (default 60s), automatic retries on network errors and rate limits (429/5xx), clear error messages (e.g. "check your API key" on 401)

### 🔌 Provider Support
- Works with **any OpenAI-compatible Chat Completions API**:
  - **Cloud**: OpenAI, Mistral, Groq, Google Gemini (OpenAI-compat endpoint) and more
  - **Local**: Ollama, LM Studio, llama.cpp, vLLM; no API key required, data never leaves your machine
- **Flexible configuration**: API URL, API key, model, temperature, timeout
- **Customizable system prompts** for every built-in action (e.g. `{TARGET_LANGUAGE}` placeholder for translation)

### 🌍 Internationalization
- Full UI and default prompts in **English and German** (auto-selected by Obsidian language)
- Target language for translation is freely configurable

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) 1.4.0 or newer (Restricted Mode off for community plugins)
- An OpenAI-compatible API endpoint (cloud or local)

### 🛠️ Installation

**Option 1 — Manual install**

1. Download `main.js`, `styles.css` and `manifest.json` from the repository
2. Create the folder `<your-vault>/.obsidian/plugins/llm-text-assistant/` and copy the three files into it — or use Obsidian 1.8+: **Settings → Community Plugins → Install from files**
3. Enable **LLM Text Assistant** under Settings → Community Plugins
4. Configure your endpoint under Settings → LLM Text Assistant

**Option 2 — Build from source** (Node.js ≥ 20, npm)

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd obsidian-llm
npm install
npm run build      # bundles main.js
npm run smoke      # core tests (streaming, retry, abort, i18n)
```

## ⚙️ Configuration

Open **Settings → LLM Text Assistant**:

| Setting | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **API URL** | Chat Completions endpoint, e.g. `https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions` |
| **API Key** | Your API key (leave empty for local endpoints) |
| **Model** | e.g. `gpt-4o-mini`, `llama3.1`, `mistral` |
| **Temperature** | Creativity (0–2, default: 0.3) |
| **Timeout (seconds)** | Max wait time per attempt (default: 60). Retries twice on timeout. |
| **Target language (Translate)** | Language to translate into (e.g. English, German, French) |
| **System prompts** | Per-action instructions, e.g. `{TARGET_LANGUAGE}` placeholder for translation |
| **Custom actions** | Your own actions with emoji, title and prompt |
| **Free prompt** | Show/hide the 💬 Free prompt entry |

Hotkeys: every action appears in Obsidian's command palette — assign hotkeys under **Settings → Hotkeys**.

### Local endpoint examples

| Provider | URL | API Key |
|----------|-----|---------|
| **Ollama** | `http://localhost:11434/v1/chat/completions` | leave empty |
| **LM Studio** | `http://localhost:1234/v1/chat/completions` | leave empty |

## 📖 Usage

1. Select text in the editor (or select nothing to process the **whole note**)
2. Choose an action via right-click context menu, command palette (`Ctrl/Cmd+P`), the ribbon icon ✨ or its action menu
3. The processed text replaces the selection **live** (streaming)
4. **Cancel**: click the "Processing…" toast or ⏹ Stop in the chat
5. **Undo**: use the button in the toast (8 seconds)
6. **Copy**: in the free prompt chat, hover a response and click ⧉, use "Copy last response", or press Ctrl/Cmd+C with nothing selected

### 💬 Free Prompt (Chat mode)

Open it via the context menu or the action menu. Your current selection is loaded as context — give instructions one after another, e.g. "Improve the text" or "Translate into English". **✓ Apply** writes the result into the editor, **⧉** copies it to the clipboard, **↺ Reset** restarts the chat with fresh context.

## 🔒 Privacy & Security Notes

- **No data collection**: The plugin collects nothing. API calls go directly from Obsidian to the endpoint you configured, there is no intermediate server
- **API key storage**: Your API key is stored in the plugin settings of your vault (`.obsidian/plugins/llm-text-assistant/data.json`) and only sent as `Authorization` header to the configured endpoint
